# CSSUI

CSSUI is a Github repository containing a collection of CSS user interface components that can be used to build modern and responsive web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the components in this repository, you can download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can copy the desired CSS code and paste it into your project's CSS file.

Demo and documentation available [here](https://www.cssui.dev/).

### Components

- Accordion
- Dropdown
- Fullpage
- Modal
- Range
- Slideout
- Tabs
- Toggle
- Tooltip

Each component has its own CSS file that contains the styles for that component. You can use the components individually or combine them to create more complex user interfaces.

## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-ui-lib) to install CSSUI in your project:

```bash
npm install css-ui-lib
```

## Usage

The library includes:
- `cssui.css`, a global stylesheet which contains the CSS variables used by all components.
- components folder list

Each component folder includes two files:

1. HTML template file
2. CSS stylesheet.

You can use template files as partial or copy/paste the code into the project's files according to your needs.

### Customization

All the CSS code in this repository is fully customizable, so you can modify the styles to fit your specific design needs. You can also add your own custom styles to the components to further personalize them.
